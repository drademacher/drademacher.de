title: About Me And Things I Do
---

Hello. I am a Computer Scientists and Software Engineer from Germany.

In my day to day work I am building enterprise software at various projects in Germany. Here I mainly use Java and Spring Boot at the backend and JavaScript with different libaries at the frontend.

## Programming Projects

* [JPS Implementation](https://github.com/drademacher/lab-jump-point-search) is an implementation of the *Jump Point Search* algorithm. This solves the shortest path on rectangle grids with obstacles and is much faster than algorithms like *Dijkstra* or *A\* Search*.
* [Lion and Men](https://github.com/drademacher/lab-computational-geometry) is a visualization of two different kind of problems of the Lion and Men family. You can run the applet and learn the functionality by examing the visualization carefully.
* [Not Space Invaders](https://tondorf.github.io/not-space-invaders/) is a simple game which is like Space Invaders, but not exactly. The idea was inspired by [Not Tetris](https://stabyourself.net/nottetris2).

## Thesis

My [master thesis](/master-thesis.pdf) analyzes different variants of the incremental knapsack problem. The natural definition of the problem is unsolvable, which is explained in the beginning. Thereafter I introduce an additional constraint to the problem definition such that it becomes solveable. Then I give algorithms which solve that problem as well as some lower bounds for it.

My [bachelor thesis](/bachelor-thesis.pdf) (written in German) covers an experimental analysis of an implementation of a core algorithms to solve the knapsack problem. 

## Project Euler

From time to time I enjoy solving problems from Project Euler. Project Euler is a collection of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. My solutions can be found at the [Github repository](https://github.com/drademacher/kotlin-euler), but it is highly recommanded to not copy & run the code of my solutions but to solve the problem yourself.
