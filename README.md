## Danny Rademacher

Welcome. I am a Computer Scientists and Software Engineer from Germany.

### Thesis

My [Bachelor Thesis](/pdfs/bachelor-thesis.pdf) is written in German and covers an experimental analysis of an implementation of a core algorithms to solve the knapsack problem. 

My [Master Thesis](/pdfs/master-thesis.pdf) analyzes different variants of the incremental knapsack problem. The natural definition of the problem is unsolvable, which is explained in the beginning. Thereafter we introduce an additional constraint to the problem definition and give algorithms which solve that problem as well as some lower bounds for it.

### Project Euer

From time to time I enjoy solving problems from Project Euler. Project Euler is basically a collection of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. Currently a lot of solutions can be found at a [Github repo](https://github.com/drademacher/kotlin-euler), but it is highly recommanded to not copy & run the solutions but to solve the problem themselves.

### Other Projekts

* [JPS Implementation](https://github.com/drademacher/lab-jump-point-search) is an implementation of the *Jump Point Search* algorithm. This solves the shortest path on rectangle grids with obstacles and is much faster than algorithms like *Dijkstra* or *A\* Search*
