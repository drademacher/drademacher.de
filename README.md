Welcome. I am a Computer Scientists and Software Engineer from Germany.

### Thesis

My [Bachelor Thesis](/pdfs/bachelor-thesis.pdf) is written in German and covers an experimental analysis of an implementation of a core algorithms to solve the knapsack problem. 

My [Master Thesis](/pdfs/master-thesis.pdf) analyzes different variants of the incremental knapsack problem. The natural definition of the problem is unsolvable, which is explained in the beginning. Thereafter we introduce an additional constraint to the problem definition and give algorithms which solve that problem as well as some lower bounds for it.
