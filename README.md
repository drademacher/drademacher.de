You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/drademacher/drademacher.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/drademacher/drademacher.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Thesis

My [Bachelor Thesis](/pdfs/bachelor-thesis.pdf) is written in German and covers an experimental analysis of an implementation of a core algorithms to solve the knapsack problem. 

My [Master Thesis](/pdfs/master-thesis.pdf) analyzes different variants of the incremental knapsack problem. The natural definition of the problem is unsolvable, which is explained in the beginning. Thereafter we introduce an additional constraint to the problem definition and give algorithms which solve that problem as well as some lower bounds for it.
